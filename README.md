loginAutomationForDummySite

An automation script using maven, selenium, java and TestNG. Took a dummy e-commerce website and logged in by checking elements of the page and also took screenshots. 
There are no negative tests covered in the script. 

Manual testing cases is also provided in the excel. 
For section 1.1 I tried to follow Contorion login system and wrote all the cases following that.
For section 1.2 I tried to follow few different dummy websites to cover as much as I can. 
For section 2, I wrote script for section 1.1.
